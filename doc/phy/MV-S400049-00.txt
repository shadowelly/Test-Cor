Thank you for choosing Marvell PHY products.

One of the most important document is the datasheet, but so are its supporting documents to be aware of.


The datasheet should be read together with the following documents:

1) Release notes: There is a release notes for every revision of silicon. Specific to the silicon revision, it contains an errata section which describe known bugs. It also contains a customer information section to clarify things that are not necessarily bugs.


2) Datasheet Update Document (if applicable): 
If there are any new important changes discovered after the release of the present datasheet, it will be listed here.

3) Datasheet Change History Document (if applicable): 
This shows the changes from the previous datasheet revision to the present datasheet revision.
